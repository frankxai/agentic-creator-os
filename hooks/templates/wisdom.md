## Tri-Modal Applications

### For Video (Visual + Audio + Text)

**Visual:** Photo/footage of the expert, or symbolic imagery (old books, workshop, etc.)
**Audio:** Respectful tone, slight gravitas, may include brief quote
**Text:** The expert's name or credential, the key insight

**Example Full Hook:**
- **Visual:** Black and white photo of master craftsman at work
- **Audio:** Workshop ambient sounds, calm narration
- **Text:** "What master craftsmen know that factories forgot."

### For Written Content

**Opening Line:** Introduce the source with credibility
**First Paragraph:** Context for their expertise, then the insight
**Pattern:** Authority established → Context given → Wisdom delivered

**Example:**
> My mentor spent 30 years building companies before he met me. When I asked for his best advice, he didn't talk about strategy or funding. He said three words that I've thought about every single day since.
