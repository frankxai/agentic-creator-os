## Core Formulas

### Formula 1: The Study Reveal
```
"[Institution/Researcher] [discovered/found] that [surprising finding]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Stanford researchers found that multitasking reduces IQ by 15 points."
- "A 20-year Harvard study revealed the single predictor of success."
- "MIT's AI lab discovered why humans beat algorithms at this."

### Formula 2: The Data Pattern
```
"After [analyzing/studying] [large number] [subjects], [one pattern/insight] emerged..."
```

**Examples:**
- "After analyzing 10,000 high performers, one habit appeared in 94% of them."
- "We studied 500 failed startups. The pattern was unmistakable."
- "Tracking 1 million decisions revealed why we choose wrong."

### Formula 3: The Science Behind
```
"[Field] explains why [common experience] happens..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Neuroscience explains why you can't focus after lunch."
- "Behavioral economics shows why sales tactics work on you."
- "Cognitive psychology reveals the real reason you procrastinate."

### Formula 4: The Percentage Insight
```
"[Percentage] of [group] [do/experience] this—[here's why/what they know]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "83% of CEOs share this morning routine—here's the science."
- "Only 3% of people achieve their New Year's goals. Research shows why."
- "Top 1% of learners do something most skip entirely."

### Formula 5: The Counterintuitive Finding
```
"Research [contradicts/challenges] what we believed about [topic]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "New research contradicts everything we knew about memory."
- "The data challenges the most popular productivity advice."
- "Science just disproved the 10,000 hour rule."

## Tri-Modal Applications

### For Video (Visual + Audio + Text)

**Visual:** Clean data visualization animating in, or researcher/expert B-roll
**Audio:** Subtle "discovery" sound effect, confident narration tone
**Text:** The key finding or percentage, large and readable

**Example Full Hook:**
- **Visual:** Animated bar chart showing 94% rising
- **Audio:** Soft chime, then authoritative voice
- **Text:** "94% of high performers share one habit."

### For Written Content

**Opening Line:** Lead with the study or finding
**First Paragraph:** Expand on methodology briefly, then promise the insight
**Pattern:** Credibility → Curiosity → Deliver

**Example:**
> After analyzing 10,000 creators over 5 years, one pattern emerged in those who built lasting businesses. It wasn't talent. It wasn't luck. Here's what the data actually showed.

## Research Source Guidelines

**Strong Sources:**
- Peer-reviewed journals
- University research labs
- Long-term studies (10+ years)
- Large sample sizes (1,000+)
- Replicated findings

**Use Carefully:**
- Single studies (may not replicate)
- Industry reports (potential bias)
- Survey data (self-reported)

**Avoid:**
- Unverified claims
- "Studies show" without citation
- Cherry-picked statistics
- Correlation presented as causation
