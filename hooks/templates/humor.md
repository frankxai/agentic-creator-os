## Core Formulas

### Formula 1: Subverted Expectation
```
"[Setup that implies one thing] → [Punchline that pivots]"
```

**Examples:**
- "I asked GPT-5 for life advice. It told me to touch grass. Fair."
- "The secret to productivity? Doing less. Way less. Basically nothing."
- "I optimized my morning routine. Now I wake up at noon feeling great."

### Formula 2: Self-Deprecating Truth
```
"[Confession of relatable failure] — [Unexpected lesson or acceptance]"
```

**Examples:**
- "My productivity system: panic, hyperfocus, collapse, repeat."
- "I've been 'about to start' that project for three years now."
- "I read 50 books on focus. Still can't finish a thr—"

### Formula 3: Absurdist Precision
```
"[Absurd claim] + [Specific details that make it funnier]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Scientists discovered why we procrastinate. We're still processing the findings."
- "I've achieved inbox zero exactly once. It was 2019. I remember it fondly."
- "The algorithm knows me better than I know myself. That's concerning."

### Formula 4: The Anti-Advice
```
"[Sincere-sounding advice] that's [obviously bad/absurd]"
```

**Examples:**
- "The productivity hack that changed my life: lowering my standards."
- "Want to ship faster? Care less. Revolutionary, I know."
- "The key to consistency is lowering the bar until you can't miss."

### Formula 5: The Relatable Absurdity
```
"[Universal experience] framed [absurdly/precisely]"
```

**Examples:**
- "Me: I'll check one notification. *3 hours later* So that's how cheese is made."
- "Having a great idea at 2am and texting yourself is a form of self-care."
- "The five stages of a side project: excitement, doubt, research, more research, abandonment."

## Comedic Techniques

### Timing & Structure

**Rule of Three (with twist):**
> "I've tried meditation, journaling, and giving up entirely. Only one stuck."

**Callback Setup:**
> Plant something early, reference it later for payoff.

**The Pause:**
> In video/audio, silence before the punchline increases impact.

**Understated Delivery:**
> Say absurd things with complete sincerity.

### Types of Humor

**Observational:** "Has anyone noticed that [universal truth]..."
**Self-Deprecating:** "I personally am terrible at [thing]..."
**Absurdist:** "What if [ridiculous premise]..."
**Dry/Deadpan:** Absurd content, matter-of-fact delivery
**Ironic:** Saying opposite of what you mean

## Tri-Modal Applications

### For Video (Visual + Audio + Text)

**Visual:** Deadpan expression, contrasting imagery, perfect timing cuts
**Audio:** Flat delivery, strategic pauses, comedic sound cues (or deliberate absence)
**Text:** Punchline on screen, often delayed for timing

**Example Full Hook:**
- **Visual:** Person staring blankly at overflowing inbox
- **Audio:** Deep sigh, then upbeat "productivity" music that immediately stops
- **Text:** "Inbox zero is a myth I tell myself to sleep at night."

### For Written Content

**Opening Line:** The punchline or setup
**First Paragraph:** Expand the joke or reveal the actual insight
**Pattern:** Funny observation → "But actually..." → Real value

**Example:**
> The productivity hack that changed my life: lowering my standards.
>
> I'm serious. When I stopped trying to be perfect and started trying to be consistent, everything changed. Here's what I mean.

## Humor + Value Balance

The best humor hooks aren't just funny — they earn trust and lead to insight.

**Pattern:**
1. **Hook with humor** — Get attention, create connection
2. **Pivot to value** — "But here's what's actually true..."
3. **Deliver insight** — The real content

**Example Flow:**
> Hook: "I've been 'about to start' that project for three years."
> Pivot: "Then I learned about the planning fallacy."
> Value: "Here's how I actually started shipping."

## What Makes Hooks Funny

| Element | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|

| Precision | Specific details make absurdity land |
| Timing | The gap between setup and payoff |
| Permission | Saying what everyone thinks but won't say |

- Punching down (humor at expense of vulnerable groups)
