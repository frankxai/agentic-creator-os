## Core Formulas

### Formula 1: The Opposite Truth
```
"The opposite of [conventional wisdom] is actually [the insight]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "The opposite of more features is what makes products great."
- "The opposite of hustle is actually more productive."
- "The opposite of confidence is what experts actually feel."

### Formula 2: The Hidden Variable
```
"What everyone overlooks about [topic] is [unexpected factor]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "What everyone overlooks about productivity is sleep architecture."
- "The hidden variable in learning that schools never mention."
- "What's actually driving your decisions (it's not logic)."

### Formula 3: The Disproven Belief
```
"[Popular belief/method] was [wrong/incomplete]—[here's what works]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "The 10,000 hour rule was incomplete. Here's the missing piece."
- "Multitasking doesn't work the way we thought."
- "Motivation is the wrong thing to optimize for."

### Formula 4: The Paradox
```
"[Seeming contradiction] is actually [coherent principle]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Working less can produce more output. Here's the math."
- "Constraints create more creativity, not less."
- "Saying no is actually saying yes to what matters."

### Formula 5: The Reframe
```
"[Common experience] isn't [what you think]—it's actually [reframe]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Writer's block isn't about writing. It's about fear."
- "Procrastination isn't laziness. It's emotional regulation."
- "Imposter syndrome isn't a bug. It's a feature of growth."

## Tri-Modal Applications

### For Video (Visual + Audio + Text)

**Visual:** Visual contradiction (expected → unexpected), or "aha" moment staging
**Audio:** Record scratch, pause beat, or "plot twist" musical cue
**Text:** The counterintuitive statement, bold and clear

**Example Full Hook:**
- **Visual:** Person putting DOWN the productivity book
- **Audio:** Page flip sound, then thoughtful silence
- **Text:** "The most productive people don't use productivity systems."

### For Written Content

**Opening Line:** State the counterintuitive claim directly
**First Paragraph:** Acknowledge the common belief, then introduce the twist
**Pattern:** Conventional wisdom stated → Contradiction revealed → New understanding delivered

**Example:**
> Everyone says you need more willpower to stick to habits. They're wrong. Willpower is actually the problem, not the solution. Here's what actually works.
