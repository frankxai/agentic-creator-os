# First Principles Hook Templates

Reveal the underlying structure that explains surface phenomena. These hooks work because pattern recognition is deeply satisfying to the human mind.

## Core Formulas

### Formula 1: The Universal Pattern
```
"Every [successful X] shares this same [architecture/principle/pattern]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Every viral post shares this same architecture."
- "Every successful business reduces to three principles."
- "Every great story follows this same pattern."

### Formula 2: The Reduction
```
"Strip away [the noise/complexity], and [topic] reduces to [simple principle]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Strip away the noise, and productivity reduces to energy management."
- "Remove the complexity, and marketing is just one question."
- "Cut through the tactics, and selling is understanding problems."

### Formula 3: The Building Block
```
"The [fundamental unit/building block] that [experts] start with..."
```

**Examples:**
- "The building block that master chefs never skip."
- "The fundamental unit that software architects always define first."
- "The single element that separates amateur from professional writing."

### Formula 4: The Hidden Structure
```
"[Observable phenomenon] works because of [underlying principle]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Compound interest works because of exponential math most ignore."
- "Habits stick because of a loop most people don't see."
- "Great conversations flow because of a structure anyone can learn."

### Formula 5: The Inverse
```
"The opposite of [common approach] is actually [the principle]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "The opposite of hustle culture is actually more productive."
- "The inverse of adding features is what great products do."
- "The reverse of more content is what builds audiences."

## Tri-Modal Applications

### For Video (Visual + Audio + Text)

**Visual:** Complex → Simple animation (many elements condensing to one), or whiteboard-style diagram
**Audio:** Clarifying "aha" sound, thoughtful narration pace
**Text:** The principle stated simply, clean typography

**Example Full Hook:**
- **Visual:** Cluttered desk slowly simplifying to single notebook
- **Audio:** Chaos sounds fading to silence, pen click
- **Text:** "Every productivity system reduces to one principle."

### For Written Content

**Opening Line:** State the reduction or pattern
**First Paragraph:** Acknowledge the complexity, then promise simplicity
**Pattern:** Complexity acknowledged → Pattern revealed → Application shown

**Example:**
> Productivity advice is overwhelming. Hundreds of systems, thousands of apps, endless optimization. But strip away the noise, and every approach that actually works reduces to one principle. Here it is.

## First Principles Thinking Framework

**Level 1: What is actually happening?**
Remove assumptions, observe the raw phenomenon.

**Level 2: What are the components?**
Break down to fundamental elements.

**Level 3: What is the relationship?**
How do elements interact?

**Level 4: What is the principle?**
The underlying rule governing the system.

**Level 5: What does this imply?**
Applications and predictions from the principle.

## Pattern Recognition Triggers

Words that signal first principles thinking:
- "Reduces to..."
- "Underlying..."
- "Fundamental..."
- "Architecture of..."
- "The structure behind..."
- "At its core..."
- "The principle that governs..."
- "What remains when you remove..."

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] The principle is actually fundamental (not surface observation)
- [ ] The reduction is honest (not oversimplification)
- [ ] The pattern holds across multiple examples
- [ ] Someone could apply this principle independently
- [ ] The insight creates leverage (understand once, apply many times)
