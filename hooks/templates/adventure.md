# Adventure Hook Templates

Invite the audience into an unfolding journey or discovery. These hooks work because humans are wired for narrative — we want to go on the journey with you.

```
"I found [unexpected thing] — let me show you [what's there]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "I found a pattern in how breakthrough ideas emerge. Come see."
- "Deep in the research literature, there's a finding nobody talks about."
- "I traced this idea to its source. What I found surprised me."

### Formula 3: The Map & Territory
```
"Here's the map to [valuable territory] that [few have explored]..."
```

**Examples:**
- "Here's the map to compound learning that most skip over."
- "The territory between expertise and mastery — let me draw it."
- "Few people map the space between knowing and understanding."

### Formula 4: The Quest Frame
```
"I spent [time] searching for [answer] — here's where it led..."
```

**Examples:**
- "I spent six months searching for the common thread in great decisions."

## Tri-Modal Applications

### For Video (Visual + Audio + Text)

**Visual:** Moving forward through space, doors opening, paths revealing, maps unfolding
**Audio:** Anticipation building, footsteps, ambient discovery sounds, wonder music
**Text:** Invitation language — "Let's explore...", "Come with me...", "Follow this..."

**Example Full Hook:**
- **Visual:** Camera moving through a corridor of bookshelves, light at the end
- **Audio:** Quiet footsteps, pages rustling, then opening to ambient wonder
- **Text:** "Follow me to where the research gets interesting."

### For Written Content

**Opening Line:** Use invitation or discovery language
**First Paragraph:** Establish the territory and why it matters
**Pattern:** Invitation → Territory described → Promise of discovery → Journey begins

**Example:**
> There's a space between knowing something and understanding it. Most people never explore it. Let me take you there.

### The Fellow Explorer Frame

> "I don't know exactly what we'll find. Let's go see."

### The Cartographer Frame
Position as mapping unknown territory:
> "Here's what the map looks like. These are the key landmarks."

## Best Practices

**Do:**

- Maintain mystery while promising substance

**Don't:**
- Over-promise ("This will blow your mind")
- Abandon the journey metaphor halfway

- Use adventure language for mundane content
