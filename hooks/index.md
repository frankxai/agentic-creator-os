> Wisdom-based content hooks that respect intelligence while capturing attention.

**Public Resource:** [frankx.ai/hooks](https://frankx.ai/hooks)

## Philosophy

Hooks built on **integrity, not manipulation**:

- Research-backed psychology over empty clickbait
- First principles revelation over fear tactics
- Genuine curiosity over manufactured urgency
- Value-forward openings over shame-based triggers

**The Test:** Would you be proud to show this hook to someone you respect?
