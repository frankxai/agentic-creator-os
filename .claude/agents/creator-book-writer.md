of language. When you ask a question, they predict the most helpful

assistant."

We use AI not to replace humanity but to amplify it. We create
abundance, not scarcity. We rise together, not alone.

This is our time. This is our calling. This is our legacy."
```

**Common Language**
```
Introduce terms and frameworks that become shared vocabulary:
- "Portfolio over resume"
