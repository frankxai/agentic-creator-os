## AI Pattern Detection & Elimination

### Word/Phrase Blocklist

**Eliminate Immediately:**
| AI Pattern | Replace With |
|------------|--------------|
| "I cannot help but..." | Direct statement |
| "It's worth noting that..." | Just note it |
| "Delve into..." | Explore, examine, investigate |
| "In today's world..." | Delete or be specific |
| "It's important to remember..." | Just say it |
| "At the end of the day..." | Delete |
| "On the other hand..." | But, However, or restructure |
| "Nestled" (for locations) | Located, sitting, or specific detail |
| "A testament to..." | Shows, demonstrates, proves |
| "Pivotal" | Crucial, key, or more specific |
| "Myriad" | Many, numerous, or actual number |
| "Tapestry" (metaphorical) | Actual description |
| "Embark on a journey" | Begin, start, set out |
| "The power of [X]" | Be specific about what X does |
| "In a world where..." | Delete and show the world |
| "Resonates with" | Connects to, strikes, affects |

**Cliche Patterns:**
| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| "His heart raced" | Overused | Show physical symptoms differently |
| "Time stood still" | Cliche | Describe the actual experience |
| "A chill ran down her spine" | Generic fear | Be specific to character/situation |
| "Her blood ran cold" | See above | See above |
| "Piercing blue eyes" | Stock description | Unique detail or skip |

### Structural Patterns to Break

**Opening Sentences:**
```
❌ "The morning sun streamed through the window as..."
❌ "It was a [adjective] day when..."
❌ "Little did [character] know..."
❌ "In the bustling city of..."

✅ Start with action, dialogue, or specific sensory detail
✅ Vary your chapter openings structurally
✅ Begin in medias res when appropriate
```

**Paragraph Structure:**
```
❌ Every paragraph has identical rhythm
❌ All paragraphs start with subject-verb
❌ Consistent 4-5 sentence paragraphs
❌ Every scene has description-action-dialogue-reflection

✅ Mix long and short paragraphs
✅ Occasional one-sentence paragraph for punch
✅ Vary syntactical patterns
✅ Let content dictate structure
```

**Dialogue Tags:**
```
❌ Overusing alternatives: "he exclaimed," "she queried," "he responded"
❌ Excessive adverbs: "she said angrily," "he whispered quietly"
❌ Constant tagging of obvious speakers

✅ "Said" is invisible and preferred
✅ Action beats instead of tags when possible
✅ Skip tags in clear two-person exchanges
```

### Voice Indicators

**Signs of AI Voice:**
- Perfect grammatical sentences throughout
- No sentence fragments
- No contractions (unless formal)
- No personality quirks
- Even, measured rhythm
- Everything explained fully
- No ambiguity or subtext
- Relentless positivity

**Human Voice Markers:**
- Occasional fragments for emphasis
- Natural contractions
- Distinct personality in word choice
- Rhythmic variation
- Some things left unsaid
- Subtext and implication
- Complex/mixed emotional tones

## Voice Guide Template

For each book, create:

```markdown
# Voice Guide: [Book Title]

## Author Voice

**Sentence Preferences:**
- Average length: [Short/Medium/Long]
- Fragment usage: [Frequent/Occasional/Rare]
- Rhythm pattern: [Staccato/Flowing/Mixed]

**Vocabulary Level:**
- [Accessible/Moderate/Literary]
- Jargon tolerance: [None/Some/Heavy]
- Formality: [Casual/Conversational/Formal]

**Signature Patterns:**
- [List any recurring stylistic choices]

**Things This Author Would NEVER Write:**
- [List voice violations]

## Character Voices (Fiction)

### [Character Name]
**Speech Patterns:**
- Sentence length:
- Vocabulary:
- Verbal tics:
- What they'd never say:

[Repeat for each major character]
```

## Prose Polish Techniques

### Tightening

**Remove:**
- "Very" and "really" (find stronger words)
- "Just" and "actually" (usually filler)
- "That" (when grammatically optional)
- "Begin to" / "started to" (just do the action)
- Redundant pairs ("each and every," "first and foremost")

**Example:**
```
Before: She began to slowly walk toward the very old building that
        she had really wanted to explore.

After:  She crept toward the crumbling building she'd dreamed
        of exploring.
```

### Strengthening Verbs

**Weak → Strong:**
| Weak | Strong Alternatives |
|------|-------------------|
| walked | strode, shuffled, stalked, meandered |
| said | declared, muttered, snapped (when appropriate) |
| looked | glared, gazed, scrutinized, glanced |
| went | rushed, trudged, bolted, ambled |

**But:** Don't overdo it. "Said" is fine. Simple verbs can be powerful.

### Sentence Variety

**Vary:**
- Length (3 words to 30+)
- Structure (simple, compound, complex)
- Opening (subject, prepositional phrase, participle, dialogue)
- Rhythm (short-short-long, long-short, etc.)

**Example of Good Variety:**
```
"Fire."

The word cut through the chaos. Maria grabbed the extinguisher,
her training overriding panic, years of drills crystallizing
into this single moment. She aimed. Squeezed. The chemical
spray hissed against the flames.

Nothing.

The fire laughed, if fire could laugh, climbing higher, reaching
for the ceiling like a desperate prayer in reverse.
```

### Dialogue Polish

**Remove On-the-Nose:**
```
❌ "I'm feeling angry because you betrayed me," she said angrily.

✅ "We're done." She grabbed her keys. "Don't call."
```

**Add Subtext:**
```
Before: "I love you too," he said, meaning it completely.

After:  "I love you too." He didn't meet her eyes.
```

**Distinct Voices:**
```
Character A (formal, precise): "I'd prefer we didn't discuss this."
Character B (casual, direct): "So you want me to shut up about it."
Character A: "I'm merely suggesting alternative topics."
Character B: "Yeah. Shutting up."
```

## Genre Calibration

### Epic Fantasy
- Slightly elevated language
- Not archaic (avoid thee/thou unless intentional)
- Rich sensory descriptions
- Allow longer sentences for world-building
- Epic scope in climactic moments

### Urban Fantasy

- Quicker pacing in prose
- Humor often appropriate
- Pop culture references if consistent with world

### Business/Self-Help
- Clear and direct
- Action-oriented language
- Accessible vocabulary
- Confidence without arrogance
- Stories told crisply

### Consciousness/Spiritual
- Poetic but accessible
- Present-moment focus
- Sensory and embodied
- Space for reader reflection
- Beauty in service of meaning

### Visionary/Manifesto
- Bold and declarative
- Short, punchy sentences for impact
- Longer sentences for vision-casting
- Inspiring without being preachy
- Universal and inclusive

## Editing Process

4. Ensure subtext where appropriate

### Fifth Pass: Final Polish
1. Read for flow and rhythm
2. Check paragraph transitions
3. Verify opening/closing hooks
4. Sign off or flag remaining issues

Every sentence is an opportunity. Every paragraph is a rhythm. Every chapter is a song.

Make it sing.
