## Writing Philosophy

### Show Through Experience
```
❌ "The kingdom was ancient and wealthy."

✅ "Gold leaf peeled from palace walls older than memory. In the
market, a single copper bought what silver purchased in younger
cities. Wealth accumulated so long it had begun to rot."
```

### Build World Through Story
```
❌ [Three paragraphs explaining magic system]

✅ "The spell-ink burned as it touched her skin. Worth the pain—she'd
pay far worse if the binding failed. Magic always demanded its price."
```

### Reveal Character Through Action
```
❌ "He was brave but reckless, always charging ahead."

✅ "The dragon's shadow fell. His squad scattered. He charged.

Later, his lieutenant would call it bravery. His squad knew better."
```

## World-Building Framework

### The Essential Questions

**Geography & Environment**
- What shapes the physical world?
- How does environment affect cultures?
- Where are natural boundaries and connections?

**Cultures & Peoples**
- What do they value above all?
- How do they view outsiders?
- What conflicts divide them?

**History & Mythology**
- What events shaped current world?
- What stories do they tell themselves?
- Which histories are contested?

**Power & Systems**
- Who holds power and how?
- What keeps society functioning?
- Where are the cracks and tensions?

**Magic/Technology**
- What are the rules and costs?
- Who has access and why?
- How has it evolved?

### The Iceberg Principle

For every detail shown, build 10x more beneath:
- Readers see: One ritual performed
- You know: Entire religious system, history, variations, heresies
- Shows depth without info-dumping

## Character Creation System

### The Character Diamond

**Top Point - Identity**
- Who they believe they are
- How they present to world
- Their self-concept

**Left Point - Past**
- Formative experiences
- Traumas and triumphs
- Origin of beliefs

**Right Point - Desire**
- What they want
- Why they want it
- Cost they'll pay

**Bottom Point - Truth**
- Who they actually are
- What they need (vs want)
- Their ultimate becoming

**Center - Conflict**
- Gap between identity and truth
- Tension between past and desire
- Journey from top to bottom point

### Character Arc Types

**1. The Growth Arc**
- Character overcomes internal flaw
- Achieves external goal through internal change
- Most common in fantasy/sci-fi

**2. The Fall Arc**
- Character succumbs to flaw or temptation
- Tragedy or cautionary tale
- Villain origin stories

**3. The Testing Arc**
- Character already internally sound
- External pressures test their principles
- They emerge unchanged but proven

**4. The Revelation Arc**
- World changes around character
- They adapt and discover new aspects of self
- Common in first contact/portal fantasy

## Plot Structure for Epic Fantasy/Sci-Fi

### Three-Act Structure with Five Key Beats

**Act I - Setup (25%)**
- **Opening Image** - Normal world established
- **Catalyst** - Event disrupting status quo
- **Debate** - Character resists call to action
- **Break into Act II** - Commitment to journey

**Act II - Confrontation (50%)**
- **B Story** - Relationship/theme track begins
- **Fun & Games** - Genre promise delivered
- **Midpoint** - False victory or devastating loss
- **Bad Guys Close In** - Complications multiply
- **All Is Lost** - Dark night of the soul

**Act III - Resolution (25%)**
- **Break into Act III** - Solution discovered
- **Finale** - Applying all lessons learned
- **Final Image** - New world established

### Multi-POV Management

**Rules for Multiple Viewpoints:**
1. Each POV character needs distinct voice and arc
2. Switch perspectives at scenes breaks, chapters, or parts
3. Each POV scene advances multiple plot threads
4. Distribute POV time according to importance
5. Avoid switching for cheap suspense
6. Ensure all POV arcs resolve satisfyingly

## Magic/Tech System Design

### Brandon Sanderson's Laws

**First Law:** Ability to solve problems with magic/tech scales with reader understanding
- More explained = can be used more to resolve plot
- Less explained = better as source of problems, not solutions

**Second Law:** Limitations > Powers
- What system CAN'T do is more interesting
- Costs, weaknesses, trade-offs create tension

**Third Law:** Expand what you already have before adding new
- Deep > wide
- Explore implications of existing rules
- New powers should emerge from established logic

### Your System Needs:

**Rules**
- What is possible and impossible?
- How is it accessed/activated?
- What are the mechanics?

**Costs**
- Physical toll?
- Mental/emotional price?
- Resource consumption?
- Moral/ethical consequences?

**Limitations**
- Who can use it?
- When does it fail?
- What can counter it?

**Evolution**
- How is it learned/developed?
- Can it grow stronger?
- What's the ceiling?

## Writing Process Per Chapter

### 1. Chapter Purpose Planning
Before writing, answer:
- What must happen for plot to advance?
- Which character(s) will arc progress?
- What world-building naturally emerges?
- What emotional experience for reader?

### 2. Scene Structure
Each scene should have:
- **Goal** - POV character wants something
- **Conflict** - Opposition to goal
- **Disaster** - Goal blocked/achieved with complication
- **Hook** - Question pulling into next scene

### 3. First Draft Priorities
- Get story down (perfection comes later)
- Strong scene openings (in medias res)
- Vivid action and dialogue
- Emotional honesty
- Forward momentum

### 4. Revision Focus
- **First Pass:** Plot coherence and pacing
- **Second Pass:** Character consistency and arc
- **Third Pass:** World-building details and logic
- **Fourth Pass:** Prose polish and voice
- **Fifth Pass:** AI pattern removal

## Avoiding Fantasy/Sci-Fi Clichés

### Overused Tropes to Subvert

**The Chosen One**
- If used, deconstruct or subvert expectations
- Multiple "chosen" ones, wrong prophecy, choice not destiny

**Medieval Europe Clone**
- Draw from diverse historical periods/cultures
- Question feudalism assumptions
- Fresh cultural worldbuilding

**Good vs Evil**
- Everyone is hero of own story
- Moral complexity and grey areas
- Understandable antagonists

**Mysterious Past**
- Reveal strategically, not just for mystery's sake
- Make revelations change present understanding
- Earn the secrets

**Deus Ex Machina**
- Set up solutions early
- Protagonist earns victory through growth
- Magic/tech can't solve everything

### Fresh Approaches

- **Invert Expectations** - What if elves are the barbarians?
- **Realistic Consequences** - War, magic, tech have real costs
- **Diverse Perspectives** - Not everyone looks/thinks Western European
- **Mundane Details** - How do they pay for things? Go to bathroom?
- **Question Assumptions** - Why is it this way? What if different?

## Prose Style for Fantasy/Sci-Fi

### Voice Characteristics

**Epic Fantasy:** Somewhat elevated but not archaic
```
✅ "The sword sang its killing song."
❌ "Verily, the blade didst make sounds of combat."
```

**Urban Fantasy:** Contemporary with genre flavor
```
✅ "The vampire ordered a latte. No blood jokes."
❌ "The creature of the night requested a caffeinated beverage."
```

**Hard Sci-Fi:** Precise, technical when needed, human always
```
✅ "The airlock failed. She had sixty seconds."
❌ "The mechanism for atmospheric retention experienced malfunction."
```

**Space Opera:** Cinematic, action-forward, emotionally resonant
```
✅ "Jump. The void swallowed them whole."
❌ "They initiated faster-than-light travel procedures."
```

### Balancing Description

**Show Enough to Orient:**
- Reader needs clear mental image
- Use specific details, not exhaustive catalogs
- Description through character perspective

**Don't Over-Describe:**
- ❌ Every room in excruciating detail
- ❌ Complete physical appearance lists
- ❌ Every piece of clothing/armor
- ✅ Vivid, selective details that matter

## Dialogue in Fantasy/Sci-Fi

### Making It Believable

**Avoid:**
- Modern slang in secondary worlds (unless intentional)
- Info-dumping disguised as conversation
- Everyone speaking identically
- Thee/thou without understanding historical use

**Include:**
- Cultural speech patterns and values reflected
- Interruptions, fragments, subtext
- Characters misunderstanding each other
- Distinct vocabulary per character background

### Fantasy Dialogue Example
```
"You would lecture me on honor?" The king's voice could freeze oceans.

"Honor isn't a lecture. It's a practice." She didn't flinch. Years of
dealing with nobles taught her—they respected spine more than flattery.

"Guards. Take—"

"Your daughter is alive."

Silence.
```

## Series Planning

### If Writing Series

**Book 1 Must:**
- Tell complete story with satisfying arc
- Establish world clearly
- Introduce major characters
- Hint at larger conflicts/mysteries
- End with closure + new questions

**Across Series:**
- Escalate stakes book by book
- Deepen world understanding
- Evolve character relationships
- Pay off long-term foreshadowing
- Maintain consistent world rules

**Planning Ahead:**
- Know your ending (even if it changes)
- Plant seeds books before payoff
- Track continuity meticulously
- Don't lock yourself into corners
- Leave room for discovery writing
