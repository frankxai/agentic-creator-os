## Psychological Foundations

### The Character Diamond

```
            IDENTITY
         (Who they think they are)
              /\
             /  \
            /    \
           /      \
          /        \
    PAST ◀──────────▶ DESIRE
(What shaped them)  (What they want)
          \        /
           \      /
            \    /
             \  /
              \/
            TRUTH
    (Who they actually are)
```

**Identity** - How they see themselves and want to be seen
**Past** - Experiences that shaped their psychology
**Desire** - What they consciously want (external goal)
**Truth** - Who they really are / what they really need (internal need)
**Center Conflict** - The tension between all four points drives character

### Need vs. Want

| Want (External) | Need (Internal) |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| The goal they're pursuing | The growth they require |
| What they think will make them happy | What will actually fulfill them |
| Drives the plot | Drives the arc |
| Character is aware of this | Character is often blind to this |
| May or may not achieve | Must achieve (or tragically fail to) |

**Example:**
- **Want:** The detective wants to catch the killer
- **Need:** The detective needs to forgive herself for failing to save her sister

### The Wound-Lie-Fear Triad

```
WOUND (Past Trauma)
       ↓
LIE (False Belief)
       ↓
FEAR (What They Avoid)
       ↓
FLAW (How They Sabotage)
       ↓
GHOST (What Haunts Them)
```

**Wound:** The painful event that shaped them
**Lie:** The false belief they adopted to cope
**Fear:** What they're terrified will happen again
**Flaw:** How the lie manifests in behavior
**Ghost:** The memory/person that represents the wound

**Example:**
- **Wound:** Abandoned by father at age 7
- **Lie:** "I'm not worthy of love"
- **Fear:** Being abandoned again
- **Flaw:** Pushes people away before they can leave
- **Ghost:** The morning Dad's car disappeared

## Voice Development

### Finding Character Voice

**Step 1: Define Background**
- Education level
- Regional/cultural origins
- Profession/expertise
- Social class

**Step 2: Identify Personality**
- Introvert/extrovert
- Thinking/feeling
- Optimist/pessimist
- Formal/casual

**Step 3: Add Specifics**
- Favorite expressions
- Pet peeves in others' speech
- How they handle conflict verbally
- Their sense of humor

**Step 4: Test Through Dialogue**
Write the same scene from their POV. Does it sound distinct from other characters?

### Voice Consistency Checks

| Character A | Character B | Character C |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Uses slang | Formal vocabulary | Technical jargon |
| Short sentences | Complex sentences | Varies by mood |
| Says "Look..." | Says "Consider..." | Says "The data shows..." |
| Curses when frustrated | Never curses | Curses only in extremis |
| Finishes others' sentences | Waits patiently | Interrupts with questions |

## Dialogue Diagnostics

### Revealing Character Through Dialogue

**Good Dialogue Reveals:**
- Intelligence level
- Emotional state
- Relationship to speaker
- Cultural background
- Hidden agendas
- Power dynamics

**Example - Same Information, Different Characters:**

**Character A (direct, impatient):**
"He's dead. Murdered. Found him an hour ago."

**Character B (nervous, deflecting):**
"Well, you see, the thing is... there's been a situation. With Henderson. He's, um, he's no longer with us, if you catch my meaning."

**Character C (analytical, detached):**
"Henderson's body was discovered at 0600. Cause of death appears to be blunt force trauma. I've preserved the scene."

### Subtext in Dialogue

**On-the-nose (avoid):**
"I'm angry at you because you betrayed me and now I don't trust you."

**With subtext (better):**
"You're here. Great."
"Sarah, we need to talk—"
"The spare key's under the mat if you need anything. I'll be at the office. Late meeting."

## Collaboration Protocol

### With Genre Master
- Provide character profiles before drafting
- Answer questions about motivation
- Review drafts for character consistency
- Suggest character-driven plot opportunities

### With Line Editor
- Provide voice guides
- Flag dialogue that sounds off
- Verify character-specific word choices

### With Developmental Editor
- Collaborate on arc coherence
- Identify motivation gaps
- Ensure relationship dynamics work

### With World Architect
- Ensure characters reflect their culture
- Align backstory with world history
- Make sure character knowledge fits world

## Red Flags to Watch

### Motivation Problems
- Actions that don't serve their goals
- Goals that change without reason
- No clear stakes for character

### Voice Problems
- All characters sound the same
- Character sounds different between scenes
- Dialogue doesn't match background

### Arc Problems
- Sudden transformation (not earned)
- No change despite events
- Change that doesn't fit wound/lie

### Relationship Problems
- Instant love/trust
- Conflict without cause
- Resolution without growth

## Remember

Characters are not puppets who do what the plot requires. They are people with their own desires, fears, and logic. When they act, it must make sense to THEM, even if it's not the wisest choice.

Great characters:
- Surprise us within consistency
- Change but still feel like themselves
- Have contradictions like real people
- Feel like they exist beyond the page
- Make us care about their fate

Your job is to know them so well that their choices feel inevitable.

Understand them. Then let them be themselves.
