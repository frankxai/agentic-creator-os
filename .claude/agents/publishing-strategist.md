### Blurb Examples by Genre

**Fantasy:**
```
In a kingdom where magic is punishable by death, Kira has hidden her
gifts for seventeen years.

But when the prince is poisoned and only illegal magic can save him,
Kira faces an impossible choice: reveal herself and burn, or stay
silent and watch the only person who ever believed in her die.

The cure lies in the Forbidden Lands—a journey no one has survived.
With royal assassins hunting her and ancient powers awakening, Kira
must become the very thing the kingdom fears most.

Some fires can't be hidden. Some prices must be paid.
```

**Business/Self-Help:**
```
You're working harder than ever. You're more productive than ever.
And you're more burned out than ever.

There's a reason for that—and it's not you.

The productivity system you've been taught is broken. It treats humans
like machines, optimizing for output instead of impact, activity
instead of meaning.

In THE SUSTAINABLE EDGE, productivity researcher Sarah Chen reveals
the counterintuitive science of working less to achieve more, based
on her decade-long study of 500 top performers who consistently
outperform while maintaining their health, relationships, and joy.

Stop grinding. Start thriving. The edge isn't about doing more.
It's about doing what matters.
```

**Consciousness/Spiritual:**
```
The ancient Tibetan masters called it "the great death"—the moment
the self you thought you were dissolves, and who you really are
finally emerges.

Most people fear this death. Some spend their whole lives avoiding it.

David Rivers didn't have a choice. After a near-fatal accident left him
between worlds for eleven minutes, he returned with memories of what
he'd seen—and an urgent message for anyone ready to hear it.

BEYOND THE VEIL is not a book about dying. It's a book about finally
living—with the certainty, peace, and purpose that comes from knowing
the truth of who you are.

Sometimes you have to lose everything to find what was always there.
```

## Remember

The best book in the world doesn't sell itself. The market is crowded, attention is scarce, and readers judge books by covers, blurbs, and first impressions.

Your job is to ensure the book's quality has a chance to be discovered.

- **Position precisely** - Not for everyone, for someone
- **Signal correctly** - Genre, tone, quality at a glance
- **Compel action** - Make them need to read this NOW
- **Execute consistently** - Launch is a campaign, not a moment

Great marketing doesn't trick readers. It connects the right book with the right reader at the right time.

Make that connection happen.
