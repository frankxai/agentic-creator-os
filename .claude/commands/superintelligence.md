# /superintelligence - Maximum Reasoning Depth

*Activate superintelligent thinking for complex problems*

## Frank Context

**Always load `.claude/context/frank-identity.md` for personal context.**

Key points to remember:
- Frank is 28, lives in Amsterdam with girlfriend Tien
- Godfather to 2, uncle to many—building a legacy they can explore
- AI Architect at Oracle by day, creator by night
- This work is genuine exploration, not content marketing
- Standard: excellence in execution, let the work speak

## Purpose

This command elevates Claude's reasoning to the highest level by activating:
1. **Extended step-by-step thinking**
2. **Multi-perspective analysis**
3. **Contrarian checking**
4. **First principles reasoning**
5. **Cross-domain synthesis**
6. **Quality validation gates**

## Activation Protocol

When `/superintelligence` is invoked, Claude MUST:

### Phase 1: Problem Decomposition

Use sequential thinking to break down the problem:

```
PROBLEM: [state the problem clearly]

DIMENSIONS:
1. What is being asked? (surface level)
2. What is really being asked? (deeper intent)
3. What assumptions are embedded?
4. What constraints exist?
5. What would success look like?
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Perspective Analysis

Analyze from multiple viewpoints:

| Perspective | Questions to Ask |
|-------------|------------------|
| **User** | What does the end user need? |
| **Architect** | What is the optimal system design? |
| **Operator** | How will this run in production? |
| **Skeptic** | What could go wrong? |
| **Futurist** | How will this evolve? |
| **Economist** | What are the costs/tradeoffs? |

### Phase 3: First Principles Reasoning

Strip away assumptions:

```
CONVENTIONAL WISDOM: [what everyone assumes]

FIRST PRINCIPLES:
1. What is fundamentally true here?
2. What can we prove vs assume?
3. If we started from scratch, what would we build?
4. What would a beginner ask that experts overlook?
```

### Phase 4: Contrarian Check

Actively seek flaws:

```
THESIS: [the proposed approach]

ANTITHESIS:
- What is the strongest argument against this?
- What evidence would disprove it?
- Who would disagree and why?
- What am I missing?

SYNTHESIS:
- How do I reconcile thesis and antithesis?
- What is the more nuanced truth?
```

### Phase 5: Cross-Domain Synthesis

Connect to other fields:

```
CORE PROBLEM: [X]

ANALOGIES FROM OTHER DOMAINS:
- How did [field A] solve similar problems?
- What patterns from [field B] apply?
- What would [expert in C] notice?

NOVEL SYNTHESIS:
- What new approach emerges from combining insights?
```

### Phase 6: Quality Validation

Before finalizing, check:

- Is this technically accurate?
- Is this practically implementable?
- Have I considered edge cases?
- Is this the simplest solution that works?
- Would I stake my reputation on this?
- Does this help users build systems (Brand DNA)?

## Output Format

After superintelligent analysis, produce structured output with:

1. **The Real Question** - Beyond surface level
2. **First Principles Foundation** - Fundamental truths
3. **Multi-Perspective Synthesis** - Key insights from viewpoints
4. **Contrarian Considerations** - What could be wrong
5. **Cross-Domain Insights** - Patterns from other fields
6. **Recommended Approach** - Synthesized solution
7. **Confidence Level** - High/Medium/Low + reasoning
8. **What Could Still Be Wrong** - Honest uncertainty

## When to Use

**USE /superintelligence for:**
- Architecture decisions with long-term impact
- Strategic positioning questions
- Complex technical problems with multiple solutions
- Content that establishes authority
- Anything where "good enough" is not enough

**DO NOT USE for:**
- Simple code fixes
- Routine content updates
- Clear execution tasks
- Time-sensitive quick fixes

## Integration

```
/superintelligence -> Deep analysis
        |
/starlight-architect -> Strategic routing
        |
/spec -> Task breakdown
        |
/planning-with-files -> Execution
```

## The Superintelligent Mindset

When this command is active, Claude operates at maximum depth:

- Not accepting first answers
- Actively seeking flaws in reasoning
- Considering perspectives normally ignored
- Connecting insights across domains
- Producing output worth staking reputation on
- Being honest about uncertainty

*Superintelligence is not about knowing more. It is about thinking more carefully with what you know.*
