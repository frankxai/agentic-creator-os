# /hook — Wisdom-Based Hook Generator

Generate compelling content hooks that respect intelligence while capturing attention.

## Quick Start

```
/hook [topic]
```

**Example:**
```
/hook productivity systems for creators
```

## What You Get

Two hook concepts, each with:
- **Category** (Research, First Principles, Wisdom, Counter-Intuitive, Transformation)
- **Target Emotion** (Curiosity, Recognition, Wonder, Insight, Validation)
- **Tri-Modal Breakdown:**
  - Visual Hook (camera/staging direction)
  - Audio Hook (sound/voice direction)
  - Text Hook (exact words, under 12)
- **Why It Works** (psychology explanation)

## Philosophy

| AVOID | EMBRACE |
|-------|---------|
| "Stop doing X" | "Research shows..." |
| "You won't believe..." | "The pattern behind..." |
| Fear, shame, FOMO | Curiosity, insight, value |

**The Test:** Would you be proud to show this hook to someone you respect?

## Hook Categories

1. **Research** — Ground in studies/data ("MIT found that...")
2. **First Principles** — Reveal patterns ("Every X shares this architecture...")
3. **Wisdom** — Transfer from masters ("What [expert] understood...")
4. **Counter-Intuitive** — Challenge beliefs ("The opposite is actually...")
5. **Transformation** — Pivot point stories ("The moment that changed...")

## Platform Options

Specify platform for optimized output:
```
/hook [topic] for [platform]
```

Platforms: TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, Instagram, Podcast, Article

## Resources

- **Templates:** `hooks/templates/` — Category-specific formulas
- **Examples:** `hooks/examples/seed-hooks.md` — 10 production-ready hooks
- **Prompts:** `hooks/prompts/hook-generator.md` — Reusable Claude prompts
- **Public Library:** frankx.ai/hooks

## Workflow

1. Provide topic (and optional platform)
2. Agent selects best category
3. Generates 2 hook concepts with full breakdown
4. Quality check against integrity standards
5. Output formatted hooks ready for production

## Quality Standards

Every hook must pass:
- [ ] **Integrity** — No manipulation tactics
- [ ] **Value** — Genuine insight promised
- [ ] **Specificity** — Concrete, not vague
- [ ] **Actionable** — Creator can execute this
