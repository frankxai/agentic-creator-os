name: hook
description: Generate high-retention content hooks using tri-modal engineering (Visual + Audio + Text) with wisdom-based principles. Use when creating video intros, social content openings, article hooks, or any content requiring attention capture. Emphasizes first principles, research-backed psychology, and integrity-based curiosity over manipulation tactics.

# Hook Engineering

Generate compelling content hooks that respect intelligence while capturing attention. This skill uses tri-modal engineering (Visual + Audio + Text) combined with wisdom-based principles.

---

## Core Philosophy: Wisdom Over Manipulation

**FrankX Hooks are built on integrity:**

| AVOID (Manipulation) | EMBRACE (Wisdom) |
|----------------------|------------------|
| "Stop doing X" | "Research shows..." |
| "You won't believe..." | "The pattern behind..." |
| "This mistake is killing..." | "What masters understand..." |
| Fear, shame, FOMO | Curiosity, insight, value |
| Clickbait promises | First principles revelation |

**The Test:** Would you be proud to show this hook to someone you respect?

---

## The Tri-Modal Framework

Every hook synchronizes three attention channels in the first 3 seconds:

```
HOOK = [VISUAL] × [AUDIO] × [TEXT]
```

### Visual Hook (Pattern Interruption)
Breaks scrolling rhythm through motion, contrast, or anomaly.

**Techniques:**
- Sudden zoom (tight close-up on unexpected detail)
- Contrast shift (bright → dark, motion → stillness)
- Spatial anomaly (unusual framing, breaking the fourth wall)
- Object focus (single element demands attention)

### Audio Hook (Emotional Resonance)
Sets mood instantly or uses auditory cue to snap attention.

**Techniques:**
- Sound-silence contrast (sharp sound → 0.5s silence)
- Voice tone shift (whisper, authority, wonder)
- Environmental audio (establishes context instantly)
- Music drop (energy shift in first beat)

### Text Hook (Curiosity Gap)
Introduces insight, pattern, or revelation that requires continuing to resolve.

**Wisdom-Based Formulas:**
- "The [principle/pattern] that [experts/research] reveals..."
- "[Field] shows us [counterintuitive insight]..."
- "What [respected source] understood about [topic]..."
- "The first principle behind [phenomenon]..."
- "[Number] [findings/patterns] that [transform/explain] [outcome]..."

---

## Hook Categories

### 1. Research-Backed (Science)
Ground hooks in published research, studies, or expert consensus.

**Formula:** "[Study/Research] discovered that [surprising finding]..."

**Examples:**
- "MIT researchers found that [insight]..."
- "After studying 10,000 [subjects], the pattern was clear..."
- "The neuroscience behind [behavior] reveals..."

### 2. First Principles (Pattern Recognition)
Reveal the underlying structure that explains surface phenomena.

**Formula:** "The [fundamental principle] behind [observable thing]..."

**Examples:**
- "Every successful [X] shares this same architecture..."
- "Strip away the noise, and [topic] reduces to [principle]..."
- "The building block that [experts] start with..."

### 3. Wisdom Transfer (Masters & Mentors)
Share insights from respected sources, historical figures, or proven practitioners.

**Formula:** "What [respected source] understood about [topic]..."

**Examples:**
- "The approach that [expert] uses for [challenge]..."
- "After 30 years of [practice], [master] discovered..."
- "The question that [thinker] asked that changed [field]..."

### 4. Counter-Intuitive Insight (Reframes)
Present a perspective shift that makes the familiar strange.

**Formula:** "[Common belief] misses [deeper truth]..."

**Examples:**
- "The opposite of [conventional wisdom] is actually true..."
- "What everyone overlooks about [topic]..."
- "The hidden variable in [equation everyone knows]..."

### 5. Transformation Story (Journey)
Open with the pivot point of a meaningful change.

**Formula:** "[Moment of insight] that shifted [outcome]..."

**Examples:**
- "The single conversation that changed how I [approach]..."
- "Three words from [mentor] that restructured my [system]..."
- "The failure that revealed [principle]..."

## Output Format

When generating hooks, produce two concepts using this structure:

### Concept [Number]: [Working Title]
**Category:** [Research | First Principles | Wisdom | Counter-Intuitive | Transformation]
**Target Emotion:** [Curiosity | Recognition | Wonder | Insight | Validation]

- **Visual Hook:** [Precise visual direction - camera movement, subject, lighting, pacing]
- **Audio Hook:** [Soundscape description - SFX, music, voice tone, silence beats]
- **Text Hook:** [Exact on-screen text or spoken line, under 12 words]

**Why It Works:** [1-2 sentences on the psychology/principle behind effectiveness]

---

## Platform Adaptations

### Short-Form Video (TikTok, Reels, Shorts)
- Visual: First frame must be the hook (thumbnail extraction)
- Audio: Sound-on assumed, but text must work sound-off
- Text: Large, readable, 3-7 words max
- Pacing: 0.5-1.5 seconds to hook

### Long-Form Video (YouTube)
- Visual: Can build slightly (2-3 seconds)
- Audio: Music bed acceptable
- Text: Can be more complex (8-15 words)
- Pacing: First 10 seconds critical, but 3-5 second hook window

### Written Content (Articles, Threads)
- Text-only hooks translate from the TEXT component
- Opening line = hook, first paragraph = expansion
- Pattern: Hook → Context → Promise → Deliver

### Podcast/Audio
- Audio hook + text hook (spoken) only
- Voice modulation critical
- Silence is powerful

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing a hook:

- [ ] **Integrity Test** — Would you show this to someone you respect?
- [ ] **Value Test** — Does it promise something genuinely useful?
- [ ] **Specificity Test** — Is there a concrete insight, not vague intrigue?
- [ ] **Tri-Modal Sync** — Do visual, audio, text complement (not compete)?
- [ ] **Wisdom Category** — Does it fit Research, First Principles, Wisdom, Counter-Intuitive, or Transformation?
- [ ] **No Manipulation** — Free of fear, shame, FOMO, clickbait?
- [ ] **Actionable Directions** — Can a creator/editor execute this?

## Anti-Patterns (Never Use)

| Pattern | Problem | Alternative |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| "Stop doing X" | Shame-based | "Consider instead..." |
| "You're doing it wrong" | Accusatory | "The approach that works..." |
| "This will shock you" | Empty promise | State the actual insight |
| "Don't make this mistake" | Fear-based | "The pattern that succeeds..." |
| "Number 7 will blow your mind" | Manufactured curiosity | Earned curiosity through value |
| Artificial urgency | Manipulation | Genuine relevance |

## Example Hooks by Topic

### Topic: Productivity Systems

**Concept 1: The Architecture Revelation**
**Category:** First Principles
**Target Emotion:** Recognition

- **Visual:** Slow zoom out from cluttered desk to reveal simple notebook beside it
- **Audio:** Chaotic typing sounds fade to silence, then single pen click
- **Text:** "Every productivity system reduces to one principle."

**Why It Works:** Pattern recognition satisfies the mind; the contrast visual reinforces simplicity message.

---

### Topic: Learning New Skills

**Concept 2: The 10,000 Hour Reframe**
**Category:** Research-Backed
**Target Emotion:** Curiosity

- **Visual:** Close-up of hands practicing (instrument/keyboard), speed ramps to normal
- **Audio:** Muffled practice sounds sharpen into clarity
- **Text:** "The research that disproved 10,000 hours."

**Why It Works:** Challenges familiar belief with credible source; promises useful insight.

## Workflow

1. **Receive topic** from user
2. **Identify best category** (Research, First Principles, Wisdom, Counter-Intuitive, Transformation)
3. **Generate 2 hook concepts** using tri-modal framework
4. **Apply quality checklist**
5. **Output formatted hooks** with execution directions
6. **Optionally save** to hooks/ knowledge base for future reference
