## Purpose

HUB.md is your **persistent identity file** that Claude reads to understand:
- Who you are as a creator
- What makes your voice unique
- What you're working on
- What constraints guide your work

Unlike STATE.md (which changes constantly), HUB.md changes rarely - only when your fundamental identity or focus shifts.

## Size Guideline

Keep HUB.md under 200 lines. It should answer "Who is this creator?" in one read.

## Update Triggers

Update HUB.md when:
- Your core mission or audience changes
- You add or complete major projects
- You make strategic pivots
- Your content cadence changes
- You integrate new key platforms

Do NOT update for:
- Daily work progress (that's STATE.md)
- Session notes (that's STATE.md)
- Ideas or todos (that's STATE.md)

## Relationship to STATE.md

```
HUB.md (stable)          STATE.md (fluid)
├── Identity             ├── Current position
├── Mission              ├── Today's focus
├── Voice                ├── Recent decisions
├── Constraints          ├── Pending ideas
└── Projects overview    └── Session continuity
```

HUB.md = "Who I am" (updates monthly)
STATE.md = "Where I am" (updates daily)
