# Shipped: ACOS v6.0.0 - The Front Door

After months of development and pattern absorption from the best Claude Code repos on GitHub, I'm excited to announce Agentic Creator OS v6.0.0.

## What is ACOS?

ACOS is a superintelligent operating system for generative creators. It transforms how you work with AI by providing:

- **25 Creator Commands** - Reusable workflows instead of one-off prompts
- **94 Skills** - Domain knowledge modules that auto-activate
- **40 Agents** - Specialized AI personas
- **8 MCP Servers** - External tool integrations
- **Hooks System** - Quality gates and automation

## The v6 Highlight: `/acos` Smart Router

The biggest new feature in v6 is the `/acos` command - your single entry point to everything. Just type what you want:

```
/acos "write a blog post about AI agents"    → Routes to /article-creator
/acos "make a track"                         → Routes to /create-music
/acos "build a feature"                      → Routes to /spec
/acos "strategic decision"                  → Routes to /starlight-architect
```
