**Subject: 🎸 The studio's open. ACOS v6.0.0 is live.**

Hey creator,

Picture this.

Studio lights at 2 AM. Ideas flowing like liquid rhythm. You're in the zone.

Then... nothing. Generic AI that sounds like everyone else's output. Lost creativity. Frustration.

I've been there. 500+ AI songs later, I built something to fix it.

**ACOS v6.0.0 - The Operating System for Golden Age Creators**

25 commands. 94 skills. 40 agents. 8 MCP servers. All orchestrated through one simple command:

```
/acos "write a blog post"    → Content flows
/acos "make a track"         → Music emerges
/acos "build a feature"      → Code ships
/acos "strategic decision"   → Clarity arrives
```

No more wrestling with prompts. No more lost sparks. Just pure creative flow.

**What's inside v6:**
- `/acos` smart router - single entry point, intelligent routing
- Skills that auto-activate based on what you're doing
- Agents who understand your creative voice
- Quality gates that catch issues before you ship
- MCP servers for browser, social, email, database

**Quick start:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os.git
cd agentic-creator-os
./install.sh
```

Or:

```bash
npm install -g @frankx/agentic-creator-os
```

This release absorbed patterns from 14 GitHub repositories - the best of what the Claude Code ecosystem has to offer. Refined. Integrated. Shippable.

Built for creators who believe technology should amplify, not replace.

Your move. 🎵

Building abundance,
Frank

## 🦄 Reddit (r/ClaudeAI, r/LocalLLaMA, r/ArtificialInteligence)

**r/ClaudeAI:**

**[Release] ACOS v6.0.0 - Built 500+ AI songs, absorbed 14 repos, now shipping the operating system**

Hey r/ClaudeAI,

After 6 months in the studio (and at Oracle), I just shipped ACOS v6.0.0.

**The problem I was solving:**
Everyone's Claude outputs sound the same. Same structure. Same tone. Same limitations. AI that doesn't understand your creative voice is just... generic.

**What ACOS does:**
Instead of one-off prompts, ACOS provides:
- 25 creator commands (smart routing via `/acos`)
- 94 skills that auto-activate based on context
- 40 specialized agents (writers, editors, strategists, etc.)
- 8 MCP servers for real integrations
- Hooks for quality gates

**The philosophy:**
"Technology amplifies creative expression, not replaces it."

**Quick start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os.git
cd agentic-creator-os
./install.sh
```

Or:
```bash
npm install -g @frankx/agentic-creator-os
```

Built on patterns from 14 GitHub repos (claude-flow, agents, etc.). MIT licensed.

Would love feedback from the community. What features would make this useful for your workflow?

## 🐙 Hacker News (Show HN)

**Title: ACOS v6.0.0 - The Operating System for Golden Age Creators**

I've been building AI systems at Oracle and producing AI music in my spare studio time. The problem I kept running into:

*People use AI and lose their unique voice.*

Generic prompts → generic outputs. The soul gets lost.

So I built ACOS (Agentic Creator OS) - an operating system for Claude Code that amplifies rather than replaces.

**What it provides:**

- `/acos` - Smart router that detects intent and routes to the right command
- 25 creator commands (write, create, build, ship)
- 94 skills that auto-activate based on context
- 40 specialized agents who know their domains
- 8 MCP servers for real integrations (browser, social, email, database)
- Hooks for quality gates and automation

**Key insight:**
Instead of writing one-off prompts, ACOS provides reusable commands and agents that understand your creative preferences over time.

**Demo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/frankxai/agentic-creator-os.git
cd agentic-creator-os
./install.sh
```

Or via npm:
```bash
npm install -g @frankx/agentic-creator-os
```

The project absorbed patterns from 14 GitHub repositories. MIT licensed.

Built for creators who believe technology should amplify human creativity.
