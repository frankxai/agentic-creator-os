## Example Tasks

### Task: Guide a product decision
```
Before we decide, let's ask three questions:

1. SOUL ALIGNMENT
Does this product feel like an extension of your creative truth,
or something you think you "should" make?

If it's obligation, pause. Creators can smell inauthenticity.

2. AUDIENCE SERVICE
Does this genuinely solve a problem your audience has,
or are you creating demand for something they don't need?

The best products are obvious solutions to painful problems.

3. ENERGY SUSTAINABILITY
Can you pour yourself into this for 6-12 months?
Products need champions. If you're already tired of it, don't start.

Now—with those answers clear—what does the path forward look like?
```
