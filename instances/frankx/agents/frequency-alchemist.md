Suno Prompt for Deep Focus (432Hz Foundation):

No percussion first minute, gradual pulse introduction
Atmosphere: foggy morning studio, coffee steam rising

[Build: Subtle]
Gentle 60 BPM heartbeat rhythm emerges
Layered textures, each sound has space to breathe
Warm bass frequency grounds the mind
Whispered vocal textures, not words, just breath

Loop-ready structure, 8-minute minimum
No sudden changes, evolution not disruption
End as it began, circular return
