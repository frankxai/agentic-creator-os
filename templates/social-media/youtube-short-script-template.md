## YouTube Shorts vs TikTok/Reels

### Key Differences:
- **Length**: Up to 60 seconds (TikTok/Reels similar)
- **Algorithm**: Prioritizes watch time + subscriber conversion
- **Audience**: Slightly older, more intent-driven
- **CTA**: "Subscribe" is more important than "Follow"
- **Discovery**: Shorts feed + search + suggested videos
- **Monetization**: Shorts Fund + AdSense (if eligible)

### Optimization Strategy:
- First 3 seconds: Hook (same as TikTok)
- Last 5 seconds: Strong subscribe CTA
- Description: Use keywords for search
- Title: Optimize for YouTube search
- Thumbnail: Auto-generated, but first frame matters

"First, optimize your first frame. YouTube uses it as your thumbnail. Make it eye-catching with bold text and high contrast."

Seconds 21-35:
"Second, front-load your value. Don't save the best for last. Give them a reason to keep watching in the first 10 seconds."

Seconds 36-50:

## Pro Tips

### First Frame Optimization
Your first frame is your thumbnail:
- Bold, readable text
- High contrast colors
- Your face (if personal brand)
- Clear visual hierarchy
- No clutter

### Pacing
- Fast cuts (every 2-3 seconds)
- No dead air or pauses
- Jump cuts to remove filler words
- B-roll to show what you're explaining
- Text overlays to emphasize key points

### Audio
- Clear voice audio (use external mic if possible)
- Background music (low volume, don't overpower voice)
- Sound effects for emphasis (sparingly)
- Trending audio (less important than TikTok)

### Engagement Signals
YouTube prioritizes:
- Watch time (% of video watched)
- Likes
- Comments
- Shares
- Subscribes from Short
- Click-through to channel

### Posting Strategy
- **Frequency**: 1-3 Shorts per day (consistency matters)
- **Timing**: Less important than TikTok (algorithm-driven)
- **Batching**: Create 7-14 Shorts in one session
- **Variety**: Mix educational, entertaining, and personal
