## The 3-Second Rule

**Critical**: If you don't hook them in 3 seconds, they scroll.

### What Happens in First 3 Seconds:
1. **Visual hook** (what they see)
2. **Verbal hook** (what you say)
3. **Text hook** (on-screen text)

All three must work together to stop the scroll.

## Advanced Hook Techniques

### The Pattern Interrupt
Do something unexpected in first frame:
- Sudden movement toward camera
- Unexpected sound or visual
- Contrarian statement
- Breaking the fourth wall

### The Open Loop
Create curiosity that must be resolved:
- "Wait until you see what happens next..."
- "But here's where it gets crazy..."
- "The last one will blow your mind..."
- "You won't believe what I discovered..."

### The Social Proof Hook
Lead with credibility:
- "After 10 years in [industry]..."
- "I've helped 1,000+ people [achieve goal]..."
- "This got me 1M views..."
- "Everyone's asking me about this..."

### The Urgency Hook
Create FOMO:
- "Before this gets patched..."
- "While this is still free..."
- "Before everyone finds out..."
- "This won't last long..."

## Repurposing Strategy

### Turn Your TikTok Into:
1. **Instagram Reel**: Same video, adjust caption
2. **YouTube Short**: Upload directly
3. **Twitter/X**: Upload as native video
4. **LinkedIn**: Add professional context
5. **Pinterest Idea Pin**: Break into steps
6. **Blog Post**: Expand into written content
7. **Email**: Embed video in newsletter
8. **Carousel**: Turn into Instagram carousel

### Variation Strategy:
- Same content, different hook (test 5 versions)
- Same hook, different content (series)
- Longer version for YouTube (2-5 minutes)
- Behind-the-scenes of making the TikTok

## Analytics to Track

### Key Metrics:
- **Completion rate**: % who watched to end (most important)
- **Watch time**: Average seconds watched
- **Shares**: Indicates viral potential
- **Saves**: Shows value/usefulness
- **Comments**: Engagement quality
- **Profile visits**: Interest in you
- **Follows**: Direct conversion

### What to Optimize:
- Low completion → improve hook or shorten video
- Low shares → make more shareable (valuable or entertaining)
- Low saves → add more reference value
- Low comments → ask better questions
- Low follows → strengthen CTA

"I make $50K/month" + [surprise] + "Here's how" = Strong hook
"Stop posting daily" + [curiosity] + "Do this instead" = Strong hook
"This tool is insane" + [excitement] + "Let me show you" = Strong hook
