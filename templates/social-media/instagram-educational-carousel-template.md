## Repurposing Strategy

### Turn Your Carousel Into:
1. **Twitter Thread**: Each slide = 1-2 tweets
2. **LinkedIn Post**: Combine into long-form post
3. **Blog Post**: Expand each slide into section
4. **YouTube Short**: Film yourself teaching each point
5. **TikTok Series**: Break into 7 separate videos
6. **Email Newsletter**: Send as weekly value
7. **Pinterest Pins**: Each slide as separate pin
8. **PDF Lead Magnet**: Compile into downloadable guide

### Carousel Variations:
- Repost with new cover design (different hook)
- Update with new examples/data
- Translate into different language
- Create "Part 2" with advanced tips
- Turn into "Mistakes" version (what not to do)

---

## Analytics to Track

### Key Metrics:
- **Reach**: How many unique accounts saw it
- **Saves**: Highest value metric (shows usefulness)
- **Shares**: Indicates viral potential
- **Swipe-through rate**: % who viewed all 10 slides
- **Comments**: Shows engagement quality
- **Profile visits**: Indicates interest in you
- **Follows**: Direct conversion metric

### What to Optimize:
- If low reach → improve hook (slide 1)
- If low saves → add more actionable value
- If low swipes → improve slide 2 context
- If low comments → ask better questions
- If low follows → strengthen CTA on slide 10

---

## Accessibility Best Practices

### Alt Text for Each Slide:
```
Slide [number]: [Brief description of visual content and text]
```

**Example:**
```
Slide 1: White background with bold black text reading "7 AI Tools Every Creator Needs in 2026" with FrankX logo in bottom right corner
```

### Design Considerations:
- Use high contrast (4.5:1 minimum ratio)
- Avoid color as only way to convey info
- Use readable fonts (no script/decorative)
- Include text descriptions in caption
- Test with screen reader if possible
