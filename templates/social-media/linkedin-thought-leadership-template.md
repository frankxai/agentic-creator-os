## Post Structure Pattern

### Opening Hook (First 2 Lines)
**Critical**: First 2 lines appear before "see more" - make them count.

**Pattern Options:**

**Contrarian Take:**
```
[Popular belief] is wrong.

Here's what [successful people/companies/leaders] actually do:
```

**Personal Transformation:**
```
[X years] ago, I [negative state/mistake].

Today, I [positive outcome]. Here's what changed:
```

**Bold Statement:**
```
[Controversial but true statement about your industry].

Let me explain:
```

**Question Hook:**
```
Why do [percentage]% of [professionals/companies] fail at [common goal]?

I've spent [time period] studying this. Here's what I found:
```

**Example:**
```
Most leaders think transparency is a weakness.

I've built 3 companies by doing the opposite. Here's why radical transparency wins:
```

---

### Context/Credibility (Lines 3-5)
**Pattern:**
```
[Brief credential or experience that establishes authority]

[Specific situation or observation that led to your insight]

[Why traditional approaches fall short]
```

**Example:**
```
After leading teams at Oracle and building my own AI startup, I've seen both sides of the leadership equation.

The companies that scaled fastest weren't the ones with the smartest strategies.

They were the ones where everyone knew exactly what was happening—the good, the bad, and the ugly.
```

---

### Core Insight (Main Body)

#### Option 1: The Framework Pattern
```
Here's the [Name] Framework I use:

1. [Principle 1]
[One sentence explanation]
[Specific example or mini-story]

2. [Principle 2]
[One sentence explanation]
[Specific example or mini-story]

3. [Principle 3]
[One sentence explanation]
[Specific example or mini-story]

Each of these transformed how I [outcome].
```

**Example:**
```
Here's the Radical Transparency Framework I use:

1. Share the Metrics
Don't just share wins. Share the full dashboard.
When we started posting our MRR publicly, our team became 10x more accountable.

2. Admit the Mistakes
I send a monthly "What I Got Wrong" email to the entire company.
It creates psychological safety and speeds up learning.

3. Open the Roadmap
Our product roadmap is public. Customers vote on features.
This eliminated 90% of "why did you build that?" conversations.

Each of these transformed how I lead.
```

---

#### Option 2: The Story Pattern
```
Let me tell you about [specific situation]:

[Set the scene - what was happening]

[The challenge or problem that emerged]

[What you tried first (that didn't work)]

[The insight or turning point]

[What you did differently]

[The result or outcome]

[The lesson learned]
```

**Example:**
```
Let me tell you about the worst board meeting of my career:

Q3 2023. We'd just missed our revenue target by 40%.

I walked into the boardroom with a 20-slide deck explaining why it wasn't our fault—market conditions, competitor moves, hiring delays.

Halfway through, one of our investors stopped me:

"Frank, I don't need excuses. I need to know what you're going to do differently."

That moment changed everything.

I threw out the deck. We spent 2 hours whiteboarding our actual problems and real solutions.

That board meeting became our turnaround moment.

The lesson: Transparency isn't about explaining why you failed. It's about owning it and showing the path forward.
```

---

#### Option 3: The Listicle Pattern
```
[Number] [lessons/mistakes/insights] about [topic]:

1. [Insight 1]
→ [Explanation]
→ [Why it matters]

2. [Insight 2]
→ [Explanation]
→ [Why it matters]

3. [Insight 3]
→ [Explanation]
→ [Why it matters]

[Continue for all points]

The one that changed everything for me: #[number]
```

**Example:**
```
5 leadership lessons I wish I'd learned earlier:

1. Clarity beats strategy
→ A clear direction executed imperfectly beats a perfect strategy no one understands
→ Your team can't execute what they can't articulate

2. Speed beats perfection
→ Fast decisions with 70% information beat slow decisions with 100%
→ In startups, momentum is everything

3. Culture beats compensation
→ Great people stay for mission, not money
→ If you're competing on salary, you've already lost

4. Transparency beats politics
→ Open information eliminates 90% of office drama
→ When everyone sees the same data, alignment happens naturally

5. Questions beat answers
→ Leaders who ask "What do you think?" build stronger teams
→ Your job isn't to have all the answers—it's to unlock them in others

The one that changed everything for me: #4
```

### Actionable Takeaway
**Pattern:**
```
Here's how you can apply this:

[Specific action step 1]
[Specific action step 2]
[Specific action step 3]

Start with [easiest/most impactful] one this week.
```

**Example:**
```
Here's how you can apply this:

→ This week, share one metric with your team you normally keep private
→ In your next 1:1, admit one thing you're uncertain about
→ Create a public channel where anyone can ask leadership questions

Start with the metrics one this week. You'll be surprised how it changes the conversation.
```

```

## Platform-Specific Formatting

### Character Limits
- **Optimal length**: 1,200-1,500 characters (about 200-250 words)
- **Maximum**: 3,000 characters
- **Hook**: First 2 lines (before "see more") are critical

### Visual Elements
- **Line breaks**: Use blank lines generously for readability
- **Emojis**: Use sparingly (1-3 per post) for visual breaks → ✨ 🔥 💡 ⚡ 🎯
- **Arrows**: Use → for bullet points (more professional than •)
- **Numbers**: Use for lists (1. 2. 3.)
- **Bold**: Use **bold** for emphasis on key phrases

### Hashtags
- **Optimal**: 3-5 relevant hashtags at the end
- **Placement**: After your main content, before or after CTA
- **Strategy**: Mix popular (#Leadership) with niche (#AIStartups)

### Mentions
- **Strategic**: Mention relevant people/companies when adding value
- **Avoid**: Don't mention people just for reach (feels spammy)
- **Engagement**: Mention people in comments to continue conversation

---

## Pro Tips

### Timing
- **Best days**: Tuesday-Thursday
- **Best times**: 7-9 AM, 12-1 PM, 5-6 PM (local time)
- **Consistency**: Post 2-3x per week minimum

### Engagement Hacks
